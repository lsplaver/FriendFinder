# FriendFinder

## Purpose:
The FriendFinder app is supposed to match you with potential friends based on your responses on a 10 question survey

## Description:
In this project you are presented with a survey of ten questions which are then used to match you in compatability for friends.  After or before, you are also able to see the list of all currently entered individuals in the app.  Since this is not persistant no user entered individuals will remain between browser sessions.

## Tech Used:
To accomplish this, the app utilizes NodeJS and Express.  Additionally, for the live version Heroku.

## Live Version:
The live version is located at: https://friend-finder-lawrence.herokuapp.com/
